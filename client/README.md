React Boilerplate
=====================

A minimal and light dev environment for ReactJS.

### Usage

Clone the boilerplate and create your own git repo.

```
git clone git@github.com:lighthouse-labs/react-simple-boilerplate.git
cd react-simple-boilerplate
git remote rm origin
git remote add origin [YOUR NEW REPOSITORY]
# Manually update your package.json file
```

Install the dependencies and start the server.

```
npm install
npm start
open http://localhost:3000
```

### Static Files
